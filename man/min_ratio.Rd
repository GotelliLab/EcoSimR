\title{Minimum size ratio}
\usage{
min_ratio(m = runif(20))
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a vector of non-negative trait measures, one for each species}
}
\value{
Returns the minimum size ratio difference between adjacent, ordered values.
}
\description{
Function to calculate the minimum size ratio (larger/next larger)
between species within an assemblage.
}
\details{
This index is based on the minimum size ratio (larger/next larger) difference between
consecutively ordered species in an assemblage. It is appropriate for
morphological traits, but not phenological ones.
}
\examples{
MinSizeDif <- min_ratio(rgamma(20,shape=3,scale=2))
