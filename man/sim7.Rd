\title{Sim7 Function}
\usage{
sim7(speciesData)
}
\arguments{
\item{speciesData}{binary presence-absence matrix
(rows = species, columns = sites).}
}
\value{
Returns a binary presence-absence matrix with the same
dimensions and fill as the input matrix.
}
\description{
Randomizes a binary matrix speciesData by reshuffling all
elements. Columns are equiprobable, and rows are proportional to row sums.
Makes a call to the vector_sample function.
}
\details{
This algorithm assumes that sites are equiprobable, but that
differences in frequency of occurrence among species are proportional to
observed species richness (=colsums).
}
\note{
This algorithm assumes that species are equiprobable, and that
differences among sites are proportional to observed species richness
(=colsums). sim7 has a high frequency of Type I errors with random matrices,
so it is not recommended for co-occurrence analysis.

randomMatrix <- sim7(matrix(rbinom(40,1,0.5),nrow=8))
