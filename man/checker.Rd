\title{Number of checkerboard species pairs}
\usage{
checker(m = matrix(rbinom(100, 1, 0.5), nrow = 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A binary presence-absence matrix in which rows are species and columns
are sites.}
}
\value{
Returns the number of unique species pairs that never co-occur.
}
\description{
Function to calculate number of unique pairs of species
that never co-occur and form a "checkerboard pair".
}
\details{
In Diamond's (1975) assembly rules model, pairs of species that
never co-occur in any site are interpreted as examples of interspecific competition.
A set of communities structured this way should contain more checkerboard
pairs than expected by chance.
