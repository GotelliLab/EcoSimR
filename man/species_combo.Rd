\title{Number of species combinations}
\usage{
species_combo(m = matrix(rbinom(100, 1, 0.5), nrow = 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A binary presence-absence matrix in which rows are species and columns
are sites.}
}
\value{
Returns the number of unique species combinations represented by
the different columns (= sites) in the matrix.
}
\description{
Function to calculate number of unique species combinations in a matrix
}
\details{
In Diamond's (1975) assembly rules model, species interactions lead to
certain "forbidden combinations" of species. A set of communities structured
this way should contain fewer species combinations than expected by chance.
}
\note{
This metric is most useful when the number of sites (= columns) is relatively
large compared to the number of species (= rows). Empty sites are excluded
from the matrix and are not counted as a unique species combination.
