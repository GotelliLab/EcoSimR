\title{C-score variance}
\usage{
c_score_var(m = matrix(rbinom(100, 1, 0.5), nrow = 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a binary presence-absence matrix in which rows are species and columns
are sites.}
}
\value{
Returns the variance of the C-score calculated across all possible
species pairs in the matrix.
}
\description{
Takes a binary presence-absence matrix and returns
the variance of the Stone and Roberts' (1990) C-score.
}
\details{
A large value of this variance implies that some species pairs
in the matrix are strongly segregated (large C-score) and other species pairs
are random or aggregated.
}
\note{
The matrix-wide C-score is not calculated for missing species, so empty
rows in the matrix do not affect the result. This index has not been
thoroughly tested with real data sets.
