\title{Pianka variance}
\usage{
pianka_var(m = matrix(rpois(80, 1), nrow = 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A matrix of resource utilization values.}
}
\value{
Returns the variance of the average pairwise niche overlap.
}
\description{
Takes a niche utilization matrix as in put and
returns the variance of Pianka's niche overlap index.
}
\details{
A large value for variance implies that some species pairs show high
niche overlap and others show low niche overlap. A low value for variance
implies that niche overlap (high or low) is very similar among all species pairs.
}
\note{
The resource utilization matrix (rows = species, columns = discrete
resource categories) may include zeroes, but no negative numbers or missing
values. Relative resource within a species is first calculated, so the rows
need not sum to 1.0.
