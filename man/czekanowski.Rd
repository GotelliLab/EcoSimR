\title{Czekanowski niche overlap}
\usage{
czekanowski(m = matrix(rpois(80, 1), nrow = 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a matrix of resource utilization values.}
}
\value{
Returns the average pairwise niche overlap.
}
\description{
Takes a resource utilization matrix as input and
returns the average pairwise Czekanowki niche overlap index.
}
\details{
The Czekanowski niche overlap index is averaged
over each unique species pair. The index measures the area of intersection
of the resource utilization histograms of each species pair.
Values of Czekanowski niche overlap index close to 0.0
reflect usage of exclusive resource categories, whereas values close to 1.0
reflect similar resource utilization spectra.

\deqn{O_{jk} = O_{kj} = 1 - 0.5\sum_{i=1}^n|p_{ij} - p_{ik}|}{O_jk = O_kj = 1 - 0.5*sum|p_ij - p_ik|}'
}
\note{
The resource utilization matrix (rows = species, columns = discrete
resource categories) may include zeroes, but no negative numbers or missing
values. Relative resource within a species is first calculated, so the rows
need not sum to 1.0.
