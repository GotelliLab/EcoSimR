Description: EcoSimR is a package to fit null models of ecological data. It provides algorithms and metrics for niche-overlap, body size ratios and species co-occurrence. Users can also integrate their own algorithms and metrics within these frameworks or completely novel null models. See full documentation at http://ecosimr.org
